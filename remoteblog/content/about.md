My name is Ahmed Al-Jabri, I'm a recent BSc graduate from Aston University for _Cybersecurity_. My main areas of interest are Computer Systems and Networking, Distributed Systems and Secure Programming.<br>

In this site I plan to discuss a wide range of technologies, share my thoughts and present technological deep-dives on various topics of interest.
